# Simulation-of-the-Hydrogen-molecule-with-VQE-using-three-different-optimizers

The simulation of molecular behaviour is a significant area of study having applications in drug discovery, materials science, and energy research. Quantum computing offers a viable solution to this challenge by allowing the simulation of quantum
mechanical systems that are intractable for classical computers. One such quantum
method that can be used to model the behaviour of molecules on a quantum computer
is the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. The molecular Hamiltonian is mapped onto qubits in this technique, and the VQE algorithm is used to
calculate the Hamiltonianâ€™s ground state energy. Qiskit is an open-source quantum
computing software development kit that provides a user-friendly interface for implementing the VQE algorithm. This abstract presents a summary of the stages required
in simulating molecules on Qiskit using the VQE method, including constructing the
molecular Hamiltonian, translating it onto qubits, and running the VQE algorithm
using three distinct optimizers such as CG, SPSA, and AQGD.
